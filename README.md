# Bank_Telemarketing_Data_Analysis

The data is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to assess if the product (bank term deposit) would be subscribed  ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

Objectives:
1.	To maximize the number of clients 
2.	To maximize the sales and revenue of bank

Constraints:
1.	To reduce or minimize the marketing cost

The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).
